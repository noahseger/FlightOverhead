### Phase 2: Location Services and Background Processing
### Phase 3: Flight API Integration
### Phase 4: Notification System
### Phase 5: Image Handling
### Phase 6: User Interface
### Phase 7: Integration and Optimization
### Phase 8: Polishing and Release Preparation

## LLM Prompts for Implementation

Let's begin with the code generation prompts for each step:

### Prompt 1: Project Setup and Data Models

```
Create a cross-platform mobile project for a flight notification app using React Native with TypeScript:

1. Initialize a new React Native project named "FlightOverhead" with TypeScript template
2. Set up the following dependencies:
   - Redux Toolkit for state management
   - React Navigation for routing
   - AsyncStorage for local storage
   - Axios for API calls
   - Jest and React Native Testing Library for testing

3. Create the core data models:

   a. Create a Flight interface with:
   - id: string
   - flightNumber: string
   - aircraftType: string
   - origin: string (airport code)
   - originCity: string
   - destination: string (airport code)
   - destinationCity: string 
   - altitude: number (in feet)
   - heading: number (in degrees)
   - speed: number (in knots)
   - latitude: number
   - longitude: number
   - timestamp: number

   b. Create an AppSettings interface with:
   - detectionRadiusKm: number (default: 5.0)
   - lastKnownLocation: {latitude: number, longitude: number} | null

4. Write unit tests for these data models to verify type safety and proper structure.

Use clean architecture principles with layers for domain, data, and presentation.
```

### Prompt 2: Local Database Setup and Repository Pattern

```
Building on our FlightOverhead app with Flight and AppSettings data models, implement local storage:

     * getData<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null>
     * removeData(key: string): Promise<void>
     * getAllKeys(): Promise<string[]>

2. Create repository classes:
   - FlightRepository:
     * saveFlights(flights: Flight[]): Promise<void>
     * getFlightById(id: string): Promise<Flight | null>
     * getAllFlights(): Promise<Flight[]>
     * deleteAllFlights(): Promise<void>
     * Add methods to query flights by date and other criteria

   - SettingsRepository:
     * saveSettings(settings: AppSettings): Promise<void>
     * getSettings(): Promise<AppSettings>
     * updateDetectionRadius(radiusKm: number): Promise<void>
     * updateLastKnownLocation(location: {latitude: number, longitude: number}): Promise<void>

3. Add typesafe serialization/deserialization with proper error handling
